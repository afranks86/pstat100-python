    "# Background: diatoms and paleoclimatology\n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms are a type of phytoplankton -- they are photosynthetic algae that function as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Diatoms are at the bottom of the food web: they are consumed by filter feeders, like clams, mussels, and many fish, which are in turn consumed by larger organisms like scavengers and predators and, well, us. As a result, changes in the composition of diatom species in marine ecosystems have ripple effects that can dramatically alter overall community structure in any environment of which marine life forms a part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms have glass bodies. As a group of organisms, they display a great diversity of body shapes, and many are quite elaborate. The image below, taken from a Scientific American article, shows a small sample of their shapes and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='figures/diatoms-sciam.jpg' style='width:400px'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are made of glass, diatoms preserve extraordinarily well over time. When they die, their bodies sink and form part of the sediment. Due to their abundance, there is a sort of steady rain of diatoms forming part of the sedimentation process, which produces sediment layers that are dense with diatoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sedimentation is a long-term process spanning great stretches of time, and the deeper one looks in sediment, the older the material. Since diatoms are present in high density throughout sedimentation layers, and they preserve so well, it is possible to study their presence over longer time spans -- potentially hundreds of thousands of years. \n",
    "\n",
    "A branch of paleoclimatology is dedicated to studying changes in biological productivity on geologic time scales, and much research in this area has involved studying the relative abundances of diatoms. In this assignment, you'll do just that on a small scale and work with data from sediment cores taken in the gulf of California at the location indicated on the map:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll use the exploratory techniques we've been discussing in class to analyze the relative abundances of diatom taxa over a time span of 15,000 years. This will involve practicing the following:\n",

    "The data are diatom counts sampled from evenly-spaced depths in a sediment core from the gulf of California. In sediment cores, depth correlates with time before the present -- deeper layers are older -- and depths are typically chosen to obtain a desired temporal resolution. The counts were recorded by sampling material from sediment cores at each depth, and examining the sampled material for phytoplankton cells. For each sample, phytoplankton were identified at the taxon level and counts of diatom taxa were recorded along with the total number of phytoplankton cells identified. Thus:\n",

    "### Question 6: Visualizing summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i) Create a plot of the average relative abundances and their variation over time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reset the index of `diatom_summary` so that the taxon names are stored as a column and not an index. Store the result as `plot_df`.\n",
    "2. Create an Altair chart based on `plot_df` with *no marks* -- just `alt.Chart(...).encode(...)` -- and pass the columnn of taxon names to the `Y` encoding channel with the title 'Taxon' and sorted in descending order of mean relative abundance. Store the result as `base`.\n",
    "    + *Hint*: `alt.Y(..., sort = {'field': 'column', 'order': 'descending'})` will sort the Y channel by 'column' in descending order.\n",
    "3. Modify `base` to create a point plot of the average relative abundances for each taxon; store the result as `means`.\n",
    "    + Average relative abundance (the mean you calculated in Q1 (a)) should appear on the x axis, and taxon on the y axis.\n",
    "    + Since the `Y` encoding was already specified in `base`, you do not need to add a `Y` encoding at this stage.\n",
    "    + Give the x axis the title 'Average relative abundance'.\n",
    "4. Modify `base` to create a plot with bars spanning two standard deviations in either direction from the mean. Store the result as `bars`.\n",
    "    + First use `base.transform_calculate(...)` to compute `lwr` and `upr` for the positions of the bar endpoints:\n",
    "        - $\\texttt{lwr} = \\texttt{mean} - 2\\times\\texttt{std}$\n",
    "        - $\\texttt{upr} = \\texttt{mean} + 2\\times\\texttt{std}$.\n",
    "    + Then append `.mark_errorbar().encode(...)` to the chain:\n",
    "        - pass `lwr:Q` to the `X` encoding channel with the title 'Average relative abundance' (to match the point plot)\n",
    "        - pass `upr:Q` to the `X2` encoding channel (no specific title needed).\n",
    "5. Layer the plots: `means + bars`. Store the result as `fig2` and display the figure.\n",

    "It may help to have a look at [this example](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/simple_scatter_with_errorbars.html).\n",

    "> **Comment:** There are a disproportionately large number of zeroes, because in many samples no *Azpeitia nodulifer* diatoms were observed. This is a common phenomenon in ecological data, and even has a name: it results in a 'zero inflated' distribution of values. The statistician to identify and name the phenomenon was Diane Lambert in 1992. Zero inflation can present a variety of challenges. You may have noticed, for example, that there was no bandwidth parameter for the KDE that *both* captured the shape of the histogram near zero *and* away from zero, regardless of the choice of kernel. The key difficulty with zero inflated data is that no common probability distribution fits the data well. This requires the use of mixtures as probability models, which are challenging to incorporate into common statistical models.\n",

    "There was a transition between geological epochs during the time span covered by the diatom data. The oldest data points in the diatom data correspond to the end of the Pleistocene epoch (ice age), at which time there was a pronounced warming (Late Glacial Interstadial, 14.7 - 12.9 KyrBP) followed by a return to glacial conditions (Younger Dryas, 12.9 - 11.7 KyrBP). \n",

    "### (Optional) Question 13: Multi-panel visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's helpful to see marginal distributions together with a scatterplot. Follow the steps below to create a multi-panel figure with marginal density estimates appended to the projected scatter from the previous question.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Altair chart based on `projected_data` and use `.transform_calculate(...)` to define a variable `holocene` that indicates whether `Age` is older than 11,000 years. Store the result as `base`.\n",
    "2. Modify `base` to add points with the following encodings. \n",
    "    + Pass PC1 to the `X` encoding channel and title the axis 'A. Nodulifer/non-A. nodulifer composition'.\n",
    "    + Pass PC2 to the `Y` encoding channel and title the axis 'Complex community composition'.\n",
    "    + Pass the variable you created in step 1. to the `color` encoding channel and title it 'Holocene'.\n",
    "    Store the result as `scatter`.\n",
    "3. Construct plots of kernel density estimates for each principal component conditional on age being older than 11,000 years:\n",
    "    + modify `base` to create a `top_panel` plot with the KDE curves for PC1, with color corresponding to the age indicator from the `.transform_calculate(...)` step in making the base layer;\n",
    "    + modify `base` again to create a `side_panel` plot with the KDE curves for PC2, rotated 90 degrees relative to the usual orientation (flip the typical axes), and with color corresponding to the age indicator from the `.transform_calculate(...)` step in making the base layer.\n",
    "4. Then, resize these panels appropriately (top should be thin, side should be narrow), and use Altair's faceting operators `&` (vertical concatenation) and `|` (horizontal concatenation) to combine them with your scatterplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the result as `fig9` and display the figure."

    "Before 11,000 years ago, *A. nodulifer* were more abundant relative to other taxa (PC1 is typically positive), and the same period is characterized by low levels of abundance of other taxa, but possibly some proportion of *Coscinodiscus* and *Actinoptychus* in the community (PC2 is typically slightly negative); most variation in the community composition is driven by variation in the relative abundance of *A. nodulifer*. By contrast, between 11,000 years ago and now, *A.nodulifer* are generally less abundant and most of the variation in community composition is driven by alternations in the relative abundances of *Coscinodiscus* and *Actinoptychus* with those of *Cyclotella* and *R. tesselata*. The markedly different relationships between the community composition indices given by the PCs suggests that the dynamics of community composition may have shifted around the time of the last major climate change event, and in particular that the present community is both more dynamic (varies more) and diverse (based on a greater number of taxa)."
